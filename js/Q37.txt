- `NaN` stands for "Not-a-Number" and represents an unrepresentable or undefined numerical result.
- It is a special value and a property of the global object in JavaScript.
- `NaN` is typically the result when a mathematical operation fails to produce a meaningful numeric value or encounters an undefined value.
- Any arithmetic operation involving `NaN` as an operand will produce `NaN` as the result.
- `NaN` has unique behavior; it is not equal to any other value, including itself. Comparing with `NaN` using the equality operators (`==` or `===`) will return `false`.
- To check if a value is `NaN`, you should use the `isNaN()` function or the `Number.isNaN()` method, which both return `true` if the value is `NaN`.
- `NaN` tends to propagate through subsequent operations once it is generated in a computation.
- Handling cases where `NaN` might be produced in your code is important to avoid unexpected behavior or errors.
