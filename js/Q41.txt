Escape characters are special characters in a string that are preceded by a backslash (\). They are used to represent characters that have special meaning in JavaScript or to include characters that cannot be typed directly.

Here are a few common uses of escape characters:

1. To include special characters: Escape characters allow you to include special characters within a string that would otherwise be interpreted differently. For example:
   ```javascript
   var message = "This is a \"quoted\" text."; // Using \" to include double quotes within the string
   console.log(message); // Output: This is a "quoted" text.
   ```

2. To represent line breaks: Escape characters can be used to represent line breaks within a string. The most commonly used escape character for this purpose is `\n`.
   ```javascript
   var multiLine = "This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.";
   console.log(multiLine);
   // Output:
   // This is the first line.
   // This is the second line.
   ```

3. To include special Unicode characters: Escape sequences can represent Unicode characters using the `\u` followed by a four-digit hexadecimal value.
   ```javascript
   var specialChar = "\u00A9"; // The Unicode for the copyright symbol
   console.log(specialChar); // Output: Â©
   ```

4. To include characters that have special meaning: Certain characters have special meaning in JavaScript syntax, such as backslashes (`\`), single quotes (`'`), and double quotes (`"`). To include them in a string, you need to escape them using a backslash.
   ```javascript
   var filePath = "C:\\Program Files\\MyApp\\file.txt"; // Escaping backslashes
   console.log(filePath); // Output: C:\Program Files\MyApp\file.txt
   ```

Escape characters provide a way to include special characters and represent specific meanings within strings, ensuring correct interpretation and representation of the desired content.
