In Node.js, `process.nextTick()` is a method that allows you to schedule a function to be executed on the next pass of the event loop, immediately after the current operation completes.

Here's a summary of `process.nextTick()`:

- `process.nextTick()` is used to defer the execution of a function to the next iteration of the event loop.
- It is often used to ensure that a callback function is executed asynchronously but before any other I/O events or timers.
- Callbacks scheduled with `process.nextTick()` have a higher priority than other asynchronous operations.
- The callbacks scheduled with `process.nextTick()` are executed in the order they are scheduled.
- Unlike `setTimeout()` and `setImmediate()`, `process.nextTick()` doesn't introduce any additional delay. The scheduled function is executed as soon as possible.
- It is commonly used in cases where you want to guarantee that a callback is executed asynchronously, regardless of the current phase of the event loop.

Example usage:

```javascript
function someAsyncOperation(callback) {
  // Perform some asynchronous operation
  // ...

  // Schedule the callback to be executed on the next pass of the event loop
  process.nextTick(callback);
}

console.log("Start");

someAsyncOperation(() => {
  console.log("Async operation completed");
});

console.log("End");
```

Output:

```
Start
End
Async operation completed
```

In this example, the `someAsyncOperation()` function performs an asynchronous operation and schedules the provided callback function using `process.nextTick()`. The callback is executed immediately after the current operation completes but before other I/O events or timers.

The output demonstrates that the callback function is executed asynchronously, after the "Start" and "End" messages are logged.
