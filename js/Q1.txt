What is difference between let and const? What is the difference between let and var?

- `let` allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned a new value and are block-scoped.
- `const` allows you to declare variables that are read-only and cannot be reassigned after being assigned a value. They are also block-scoped.
- `var` is the older way of declaring variables in JavaScript. It is function-scoped, allows redeclaration within the same scope, and gets hoisted to the top of its scope.
