object chaining is a method in js where object is created with many methods inside it and those methods are called simultaneously one after another returning the object itself .

ex

const obj = {
  value: 0,

  add(num) {
    this.value += num;
    return this;
  },

  sub(num) {
    this.value -= num;
    return this;
  }
};

var result = obj.add(5).sub(3).value;
console.log(result); // Output: 2


Object chaining, also known as method chaining, is a technique in JavaScript that allows multiple methods to be called on an object in a sequential manner, where each method call returns the object itself. This enables concise and readable code by chaining together a series of operations on the same object without the need for intermediate variables.
