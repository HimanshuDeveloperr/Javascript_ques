The expression console.log(null === undefined) will output false.

This is because null and undefined are different types in JavaScript. null is of type 'object', while undefined is of type 'undefined'. Although they both represent the absence of a value, they are distinct in terms of their type and usage.

The expression console.log(null == undefined) will output true.

In JavaScript, the loose equality operator (==) performs type coercion, which means it can convert the operands to a common type before comparison. When comparing null and undefined using ==, they are considered equal because both represent the absence of a value. JavaScript treats them as "equal" in the context of loose equality.
