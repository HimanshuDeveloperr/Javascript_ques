The reduce method in JavaScript is used to reduce an array to a single value by applying a reducer function to each element of the array. It iterates over the array and accumulates a result based on the logic defined in the reducer function.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
