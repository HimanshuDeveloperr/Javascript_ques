The main difference between fat arrow functions (also known as arrow functions) and normal functions in JavaScript lies in their behavior regarding the this keyword, function binding, and the arguments object.

this binding: In arrow functions, the value of this is lexically determined, meaning it takes the value of this from the surrounding code context. It does not create its own this context. In contrast, normal functions have their own this context, which is determined by how they are called or invoked.







Fat Arrow Functions:
- Lexical `this` binding (value of `this` is determined by the surrounding code context)
- No separate `arguments` object (inherits `arguments` from the enclosing scope)
- Concise syntax using `=>` (fat arrow) and no `function` keyword
- Implicit return for single-line expressions
- Cannot be used as constructors to create objects

Normal Functions:
- Dynamic `this` binding (value of `this` is determined by how the function is called)
- Have their own `arguments` object
- Syntax using the `function` keyword
- Explicit `return` statements
- Can be used as constructors to create objects using `new`

These points highlight some of the key distinctions between fat arrow functions and normal functions in JavaScript.
