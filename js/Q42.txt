In JavaScript, `break` and `continue` are control flow statements used in loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to alter the flow of execution.

1. `break` statement:
   - When encountered within a loop, the `break` statement terminates the loop prematurely.
   - It immediately exits the loop and continues with the code that follows the loop.
   - The `break` statement is typically used to exit a loop when a certain condition is met or to stop iterating over an array or collection.
   - It can also be used to exit a `switch` statement.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     if (i === 3) {
       break;
     }
     console.log(i);
   }
   // Output: 0 1 2
   ```

2. `continue` statement:
   - When encountered within a loop, the `continue` statement skips the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration.
   - It jumps to the next iteration of the loop, effectively skipping any code below it for that particular iteration.
   - The `continue` statement is typically used when you want to skip specific iterations based on certain conditions.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
     if (i === 2) {
       continue;
     }
     console.log(i);
   }
   // Output: 0 1 3 4
   ```

The key difference between `break` and `continue` statements is their effect on the loop flow:
- `break` terminates the loop completely, exiting the loop entirely and continuing with the code outside the loop.
- `continue` skips the remaining code for the current iteration, but continues with the next iteration of the loop.

Both `break` and `continue` are powerful flow control tools that allow you to customize the behavior of loops based on specific conditions, providing more flexibility and control over the loop execution flow.
