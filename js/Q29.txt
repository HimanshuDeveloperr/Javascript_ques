1:-object literals using this method we could create an object enclosed inside a curly braces with their key value pairs

const obj={
    key:value
}

2:-constructor functions it is used to create multiple objects with same properties in it  and invoked by new keyword

fun obj(p1,p2,p3){
    this.proprerty1=p1,
    this.propertiy2=p2,
    this.proprerty3=p3
}

var obj1=new obj(p1,p2,p3)

3:-by using object.create which takes an object as its parameter inheriting its property and then gives a new object with the properties of its prototype object and the properties that we defined .

const prototype={
    greet:function(){
        console.log(this is a prototype object )
    }
}

const jhon=object.create(prototype)

jhon.name=jhon
jhon.age=30
